## Problem Statement

AtliQ Hardware, a prominent manufacturer of computer hardware in India and other countries, faces challenges in making timely and informed decisions based on data. To address this, the management plans to expand its data analytics team by recruiting additional junior data analysts. A SQL challenge was initiated as part of the hiring process to assess candidates' proficiency in technical skills as well as their ability to demonstrate soft skills.

## Tools Used

### MySQL
- **Concepts Used:** Joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Subqueries, Window functions, String functions, Numeric functions, Date functions, and more.

### Power BI
- **DAX Measures Created**
- **Data Modeling:** Tables connected through data modeling.
- **Visuals Used:** Bar Chart, Line Chart, Pie Chart, Metrics Table, Microsoft Azure Maps.

### Canva
- Created different slides for presenting findings.

## Key Learnings

In this project, I've learned the importance of ad hoc SQL queries for gaining quick insights and understanding overall trends. The process involved:

- Importing data into both tools.
- Understanding and querying the tasks assigned.
- Presenting each task outcome in Power BI visuals for an effective and appealing look.
- Creating slides in Canva for presenting findings.

These experiences have expanded my knowledge in SQL, data visualization, and problem-solving skills.

## Conclusion

This project has been instrumental in deepening my understanding of SQL's role in data analytics. It has enhanced my ability to extract meaningful insights from data and present them effectively to stakeholders. I look forward to applying these skills in future projects to drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.
